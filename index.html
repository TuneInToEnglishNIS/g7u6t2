           <h1 style="top: 680px;">
            A long long time ago there was a volcano <br>
            Living all alone in the middle of the sea <br>
            He sat high above his bay watching all the couples play <br>
            And wishing that he had someone too <br>
            And from his lava came this song of hope that he sang <br>
            Out loud every day for years and years <br>
            Living all alone in the middle of the sea <br>
            He sat high above his bay watching all the couples play <br>
            And wishing that he had someone too <br>
            And from his lava came this song of hope that he sang <br>
            Out loud every day for years and years <br>
            Uku (The lonely Volcano): Kuana Torres Kahele <br>
            I have a dream I hope will come true <br>
            That you’re here with me and I’m here with you <br>
            I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above-a <br>
            Will send me someone to lava <br>
            Years of singing all alone turned his lava into stone <br>
            Until he was on the brink of extinction <br>
            Until he was on the brink of extinction <br>
            But little did he know that living in the sea below <br>
            Another volcano was listening to his song <br>
            Every day she heard his tune her lava grew and grew <br>
            Because she believed his song was meant for her <br>
            Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea <br>
            As he sang his song of hope for the last time <br>
            Another volcano was listening to his song <br>
            Every day she heard his tune her lava grew and grew <br>
            Because she believed his song was meant for her <br>
            Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea <br>
            As he sang his song of hope for the last time <br>
            [Uku] <br>
            I have a dream I hope will come true <br>
            That you’re here with me and I’m here with you <br>
            I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above-a <br>

            Will send me someone to lava <br>
            [Narrator] <br>
            Rising from the sea below stood a lovely volcano <br>
            Looking all around but she could not see him <br>
            He tried to sing to let her know that she was not there alone <br>
            But with no lava, his song was all gone <br>
            He filled the sea with his tears and watched his dreams disappear <br>
            As she remembered what his song meant to her <br>
            Looking all around but she could not see him <br>
            He tried to sing to let her know that she was not there alone <br>
            But with no lava, his song was all gone <br>
            He filled the sea with his tears and watched his dreams disappear <br>
            As she remembered what his song meant to her <br>
            [Lele (Love interest of Uku)] <br>
            I have a dream I hope will come true <br>
            That you’re here with me and I’m here with you <br>
            I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above-a <br>
            Will send me someone to lava <br>
            Oh they were so happy to finally meet above the sea <br>
            All together now their lava grew and grew <br>
            No longer are they all alone with aloha as their new home <br>
            And when you visit them this is what they sing <br>
            [Outro: Uku and Lele] <br>
            I have a dream I hope will come true <br>
            That you’ll grow old with me and I’ll grow old with you <br>
            We thank the earth, sea, the sky we thank too. <br>
            I lava you <br>
            I lava you <br>
            I lava you <br>
            That you’ll grow old with me and I’ll grow old with you <br>
            We thank the earth, sea, the sky we thank too <br>
            I lava you
